                            I'm reversegremlin, a solo game developer with a passion for creating cozy, engaging experiences. 
                            Inspired by my love for Animal Crossing and its charming blend of strategy and relaxation, 
                            I set out to craft a game that combines the excitement of market trading with the joy of 
                            cultivating your own world.

                            Market Harvest is a personal project born from my desire to merge resource management 
                            and exploration into a unique, heartwarming experience. As a solo developer, every element 
                            of the game—its mechanics, design, and personality—has been thoughtfully crafted to spark 
                            joy and creativity in players like you.
                        </p>
